# WARNING:
Selfbots are against Discord's Terms of Service.
Which can be found at https://discord.com/guidelines and https://discord.com/terms

This code is strictly educational.

I am not liable for any accounts that get moderated by Discord due to the use of this selfbot.

# Setup:
Open **config.json**:
```
{
    "token": "YOUR_USER_TOKEN",
    "bumpChannel": "YOUR_CHANNEL_ID"
}
```
Change **YOUR_USER_TOKEN** to your alt-account token.

Change **YOUR_CHANNEL_ID** to the id of the channel that you want the bot to send **!d bump** in.
